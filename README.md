The purpose of this project is to combine teleoperation functionality and image classifcation into one application/program, which will run on the Jetson Nano Jetbot expansion.

## Requirements

- [Jetson Nano Development Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit)
- [Wavshare Jetbot: assembly manual link](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit)
- 12.6V battery charger
- micro-USB to USB cable with data transferring capabilities
- switching power supply charger with DC Barrel jack for 5V power input

*** NOTE: only one of the power supply methods is needed. While editting code, I recommend using the switching power supply. ***

*** NOTE: additional comments are in the python notebook coded. ***
